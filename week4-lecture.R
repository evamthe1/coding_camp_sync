### Week 4
### Instructor: Arthur Cheib


### Try it yourself 13- slide 17 #  ##

# (a) Import the dataset containing school's attendance (metrics_attendance.xlsx) of every public school in Chicago

# (b) Make the data look somewhat tidy!
# Hint: We need to have a column named YEAR


### Try it yourself 14 - slide 22

# (a) Import the lakers_game.csv dataset to your current R session
# This data is about Los Angeles Lakers 2008-2009 season

# (b) Separate the 'date' column into month, day and year columns.

# (c) Discover how many games the Lakers played per month for that season
# Hint: group_by() and summarize() function could help here / or the count() function

### Try it yourself 15 - slide 30 ###

# (a) Import the gapminder.csv dataset to your current R session

# (b) Create a new dataframe from gapminder that only contains information about 1952.

# (c) Transform the continent colum of the dataframe from (b) into a character type

# (d) Extract the continent column of this new object/dataframe as a dataframe

# (e) Extract the continent column of this new object/dataframe as a vector. Save this a new object

# (f) Get only the first 35 elements of this vector

# (g) Using the vector from (e) get only unique values


### Try it yourself 16 - slide 37 ###

# (a) Using the gapminder dataset, cx`reate a dummy variable (takes on 0 or 1 only),
# depending on the gdpPercap column being bigger than 15,000. if TRUE = 1; not = 0


### Try it yourself 17 - slide ###

# (a) Create two numeric variables (chose numbers that could be scores of a soccer game):
# each one named after a team in the World Cup

# (b) Create a if-statement evaluates which variable is higher and then
# prints who won the World Cup depending on which numeric variable
